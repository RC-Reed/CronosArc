The iPhone 8 arrived with:

- Heavy cracking across the top-left of the screen  
- Shattered glass near the front camera and earpiece  
- Display flickering + unresponsive areas

Removed the two bottom pentalobe screws near the Lightning port.

### **Step 2 — Screen Separation**
Used the iFixit suction tool + opening picks to lift the shattered screen.

# 🔧 3. Transfer of Components to New Screen

Since iPhone 8 screens don’t come with all components pre-installed, I transferred:

- Front camera + speaker assembly  
- EMI shields  
- Home button + Touch ID module (device-specific, must be preserved)

# 📝 7. Lessons Learned

- Patience on adhesive removal prevents frame warping  
- Touch ID components are extremely fragile — careful transfer required  
- Using a proper suction tool makes screen separation MUCH cleaner  
- Waterproof adhesive is thin; alignment must be perfect

# 🟩 8. Outcome

The repair was fully successful and the device returned to **fully functional condition**, suitable as a backup phone or dedicated testing device.

This was an early hands-on electronics repair step in my broader journey toward systems engineering and hardware competency.
