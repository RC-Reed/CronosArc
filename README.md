# ⚡ CronosArc — Personal Engineering & Homelab Ecosystem  
**A living universe of projects, systems, learning, and hands-on engineering.**

CronosArc is the long-term engineering infrastructure behind my growth as a  
**cybersecurity professional, systems engineer, builder, and problem-solver.**

This repo documents everything I build, break, repair, learn, test, and improve — from my homelab and networking foundation, to my mobile command center, to vehicle systems and field engineering projects.

This is not a static project.  
It is a **continuously evolving engineering universe**.

# 🧭 Mission  
Build a multi-domain system that levels up my abilities across:

- Cybersecurity  
- Linux systems & automation  
- Networking & homelab architecture  
- Systems engineering  
- Hardware repair & electronics  
- Power systems & integration  

CronosArc is the framework that keeps all of this connected, documented, and progressing.

# 🚀 Featured Engineering Work  

### **📱 Side Projects (Repairs & Builds)**  
This section contains smaller, completed hands-on engineering tasks — such as device repairs, laptop rebuilds, and electronics work.  
➡️ `side-projects/`  

---

# 🔮 Future Projects (Planned Concepts)  
These projects are planned, defined, and will be built over time as CronosArc evolves:

- **TruckHQ Command Rig** — a clean, OEM+ vehicle-based systems engineering platform  
- **Portable Tech Kit** — a modular field-system for power, connectivity, diagnostics, and repair  
- **Maker Space Closet Build** — dedicated engineering corner + micro data-center  
- **AD Homelab** — Windows domain, clients, and security lab inside Proxmox  

(These will be added back into the Featured Projects list once construction begins.)

---

# 🧠 Learning System  
CronosArc includes a **multi-source learning system**, with structured notes from:

- online courses  
- documentation  
- videos  
- labs  
- books  
- study pathways  

➡️ `learning/`

Learning is not separate from engineering — it fuels it.

# 🌐 Architecture Overview  
CronosArc brings together:

- **Homelab (Proxmox, AD Lab, services) — future expansion**  
- **HP Spectre Mobile Linux Command Center — in repair phase**  
- **TruckHQ Command Rig — future integration planned**  

Each subsystem is designed to interface with the others.

# 🔧 Engineering Philosophy  
- Build clean.  
- Document everything.  
- Improve continuously.  
- Stay modular.  
- Use engineering to express creativity and discipline.  

CronosArc is built the same way I am built: **one improvement at a time**.
