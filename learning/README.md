# 📘 Learning System  
CronosArc includes a structured, multi-source learning system designed to support growth across cybersecurity, Linux, networking, systems, engineering, and hands-on projects.

This folder contains **notes**, **deep dives**, **course outlines**, and **technical reflections** — all written to reinforce understanding and build long-term skill.

---

# 🎓 Purpose  
To create a clear and professional learning trail that shows:

- what I studied  
- what I learned  
- how it connects to my homelab and engineering work  
- how it improves my problem-solving ability  

Learning is part of the engineering process — not separate from it.

# 📚 Structure  

### **1. Course Notes**  
Notes taken from videos, documentation, books, labs, and other sources.  
➡️ `learning/courses/`

### **2. Deep Dives**  
Focused research on specific technologies or concepts.  
➡️ `learning/deep-dives/`

### **3. Reflections**  
Short writeups explaining what I learned, what I struggled with, and what I want to revisit.  
➡️ `learning/reflections/`

### **4. Templates**  
Standardized note formats for consistency.  
➡️ `learning/templates/`

# 🛠 How This Integrates with CronosArc  

- Concepts studied here are **tested in the homelab**  
- Important learning becomes part of **AIDEN's knowledge base (future)**  
- Architecture and engineering decisions reference notes here  
- Repair logs and build logs link back to relevant learning

# 🧠 Philosophy  
The goal is **not** to memorize — it is to understand, document, and apply.  
This learning system grows with me over months and years.
