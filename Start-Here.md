# 🚀 Start Here  
**Welcome to CronosArc**

This document helps new viewers (and future me) navigate the ecosystem.

## 🔧 What Is CronosArc?
CronosArc is my long-term engineering, cybersecurity, and systems development universe.  
It combines:

- my homelab  
- my mobile command tools  
- my vehicle build concepts  
- my learning journey  
- my repair logs  
- my engineering philosophy  

It’s designed to grow with me, year after year.

## 🗺 Recommended Navigation Order

### 1. **Read the Main README**
Introduces the ecosystem at a high level.

### 2. **Explore Current Engineering Work**
Right now this includes primarily:
- Side Projects (device repairs, rebuilds, etc.)

As future major projects begin, they will also appear here.

### 3. **Review Future Projects (Planned Concepts)**
See upcoming large-scale builds:
- TruckHQ Command Rig  
- Portable Tech Kit (future)  
- Maker Space Closet Build  
- AD Homelab  

These folders will fill out as each project begins.

### 4. **Check the Learning System**
See how I structure my technical education:
- Notes  
- Deep dives  
- Course outlines  
- Reflection logs  

### 5. **View the Architecture File**
Understand how everything connects:
- Homelab  
- HP Spectre Mobile Command Center  
- TruckHQ (planned)  

### 6. **Open the Logs**
See real progress over time (network upgrades, hardware repairs, lab changes).

## 🧠 Philosophy
I document not just what I build, but **who I’m becoming as an engineer**.

CronosArc is meant to show the journey — not just the final results.
