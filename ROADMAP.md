# 🗺 CronosArc Roadmap  
A high-level guide to the evolution of the CronosArc engineering ecosystem.  
This roadmap is phase-based rather than date-based to allow natural, realistic progression.

---

# 🧩 Phase 1 — Stabilization & Foundations (Current)  
**Goal:** Build the physical and digital foundation of CronosArc.

### 🔧 Hardware & Environment
- Repair HP Spectre (battery, thermal paste, SSD, thermal pads)  
- Install Pop!_OS on HP Spectre  
- Prepare old gaming PC for Proxmox  
- Begin initial closet preparations for future micro–data center

### 🖥 Homelab Preparation
- Design initial Proxmox layout  
- Plan network segmentation + VLAN ideas  
- Start AD lab design  
- Create pre-deployment notes and logs  

### 📘 Learning System
- Begin multi-source learning: courses, documentation, videos, labs  
- Start structured note-taking using repo templates  

### 🛠 Side Engineering Projects
- Add completed iPhone screen repair documentation  
- Continue logging repair + rebuild tasks  

### 🤖 AI Agents (Foundations)
- Define conceptual purpose of **AIDEN v0**  
- Define conceptual purpose of **Cronos v0**  
- Outline integration requirements for both systems  

---

# 🔩 Phase 2 — Construction & Homelab Deployment  
**Goal:** Build the core systems that will power CronosArc.

### 🖥 Proxmox Deployment
- Install Proxmox on the old gaming PC  
- Configure storage pools  
- Create initial VMs (Windows & Linux)  
- Build the AD Lab (DC, clients, management servers)  
- Deploy foundational homelab services and containers  

### 📡 Network Expansion
- Begin micro–data center (closet) layout  
- Plan airflow paths, shelving, routing, cable management  
- Consider UPS + power distribution for later phases  

### 💻 Mobile Command Center
- Set up HP Spectre Linux environment  
- Configure SSH tooling and remote access  
- Build a field-tool software suite  

### 🤖 AI Agents (Prototype Work)
- First scripting and API integrations for AIDEN  
- Explore persistent knowledge storage options  
- Begin concept testing around Cronos system awareness  

---

# ⚙️ Phase 3 — Integration & Automation  
**Goal:** Connect systems and build unified workflows.

### 🖧 Homelab Automation
- Automated backups  
- Cron tasks and operational scripts  
- Monitoring dashboards and logging  
- DNS, DHCP, and internal service refinements  

### 🛠 Engineering Projects
- Maker Space Closet Build — physical layout and early structure  
- Cable routing and preliminary rack mockup  
- Add Raspberry Pi nodes (optional based on design)  

### 🤖 AIDEN v0 Evolution
- Terminal assistant for homelab functions  
- Remote command helper and automation runner  
- Structured integration with engineering logs and Obsidian (future)

### 🤖 Cronos v0 Begins
- High-level system oversight design  
- Pull metrics and generate system summaries  
- Provide CronosArc-wide health reporting  

---

# 🔮 Phase 4 — Expansion & Advanced Engineering  
**Goal:** Build out advanced systems and broaden engineering domains.

### 🧵 Homelab & Systems
- Expand Proxmox capabilities  
- Add additional services and clusters  
- Improve power conditioning and redundancy  
- Closet micro–data center Phase 2 (rack integration)  

### ⚡ Engineering Builds
- Begin Portable Tech Kit (after conceptual redesign)  
- Add maker tools: soldering, microelectronics, testing hardware  
- Begin electrical, BAS, and low-voltage learning  
- Start filming YouTube-style engineering logs  

### 🤖 AI Agents (Advanced)
- Multi-system workflows linking AIDEN + Cronos  
- Automated engineering journal generation  
- Voice-assisted commands and context gathering  

---

# 🌌 Phase 5 — Full CronosArc Ecosystem (Long-Term Vision)  
**Goal:** A mature, interconnected engineering universe.

- Fully built closet data center  
- Stable multi-service Proxmox environment  
- Complete AD + security lab  
- Seamless workflow between mobile → homelab → vehicle  
- AIDEN as a powerful operational assistant  
- Cronos as a system health and automation supervisor  
- Full engineering toolkit across IT, cyber, hardware, and electronics  
- Portfolio-level engineering demonstrations
