# 🚚 TruckHQ Command Rig  
**Long-Term Concept — Mobile Extension of the CronosArc Ecosystem**

TruckHQ is my concept for transforming my truck into a **mobile command rig** — a rolling workstation, comms hub, and power platform that integrates with the CronosArc homelab, AIDEN (automation agent), and Cronos (monitoring agent).

This is a **future-forward systems project**, currently in planning only.  
No physical modifications have been made yet — this repository section exists to document ideas, sketches, constraints, and system architectures as the design matures.

# 🌐 Project Vision  

TruckHQ is designed to eventually become:

- a **mobile access point** for my homelab  
- a **portable engineering + cyber operations rig**  
- a **real-world practice environment** for:
  - networking  
  - power distribution  
  - communications  
  - mobile systems integration  
  - AI-enabled workflows  

Think of it as the *mobile node* in the CronosArc architecture.

# 📁 Folder Structure  
TruckHQ is divided into several subsystems. Each file below documents the early ideas, constraints, and future paths for that component.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **overview.md** | High-level concept, goals, constraints, long-term integration ideas |
| **power-systems.md** | Inverter planning, 12V distribution, protected wiring, battery options |
| **comms-system.md** | LTE hotspot, Starlink plan, VPN → homelab, future AIDEN access |
| **storage-and-organization.md** | Equipment layout, truck bed storage, internal cabin layout |
| **medical-and-safety.md** | Onboard first-aid, fire suppression, wiring safety, tool kits |
| **software-and-integration.md** | Apps, automations, access workflows, AIDEN/Cronos mobile integration |
| **photos/** | Build progress photos (empty until real work begins) |

Each subsystem will expand and evolve as I gain experience, technology, and resources.

# 📡 Long-Term Capabilities (Concept Only)

These are the *big picture* ideas I may eventually pursue:

### 🛰 1. Starlink Mobile / Roam Integration  
- roof or bed-mounted Starlink dish (folding or stowable)  
- stable internet anywhere  
- automatic VPN tunnel to my homelab  
- enables remote operations, AIDEN execution, and Cronos telemetry  

### 📡 2. LTE / 5G Router Onboard  
- vehicle-wide Wi-Fi bubble  
- fallback when Starlink isn’t available  
- dedicated “TruckHQ” subnet that routes back home  

### 🔌 3. Protected Power System  
- 12V→120V inverter  
- fused + isolated power distribution  
- safe charging of laptops, radios, cameras, devices  
- possible battery box expansion (future)  

### 🧰 4. Modular Storage & Deck System  
- safe compartments for electronics  
- portable tool kits  
- documentation kit  
- dedicated area for the Mobile Linux Command Center laptop  

### 🧠 5. AIDEN + Cronos Integration  
TruckHQ eventually becomes a mobile node in the CronosArc environment:

- **AIDEN v0+**  
  - trigger homelab automations from the truck  
  - check Proxmox VM status  
  - deploy scripts or workflows through a secure tunnel  

- **Cronos v0+**  
  - monitor truck-based systems (temps, power, network uptime)  
  - track connectivity and heartbeat with homelab  
  - feed status data to dashboards  

### 🔥 6. Field Capabilities  
- remote scripting  
- study/lab work in downtime  
- emergency workstation  
- outdoor compute/video/editing station  
- portable Wi-Fi + power for events/bad signal areas

# 📝 Current Status  
TruckHQ is **in the concept and planning phase**.

What exists right now:

- file structure  
- conceptual diagrams  
- subsystem categories  
- early design notes  
- the overarching vision  

What has **not** started:

- wiring  
- mounting  
- device installation  
- equipment purchases  
- power system build  
- connectivity hardware  

This section of the repo will grow **slowly and deliberately**, and each file will expand as I define the engineering pathways for the project.

# 🚀 Next Steps (Future)  
Not actionable yet, but eventually:

- Draft wiring diagrams  
- Create network architecture for “TruckHQ subnet”  
- Define VPN tunnel back to homelab  
- Map AIDEN + Cronos interactions  
- Plan physical mounting points  
- Start researching power safety and component ratings
